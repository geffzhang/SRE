Solution

The solution (written by the user A-dog of the GhostBSD forums)forums: topic [Solved] Fatal server error - no screens found was successfully working on a HP Compaq NX 6310 (laptop of Paolo).
becoming root
Load the cd/dvd and get to the cli to login.
To becoming root by typing
su
. Of course you have to use the passphrase for your root-account.
editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf
To edit a file we need an editor. In this example we will use ee, which is installed by default.
Open the file with the editor ee by typing
ee /etc/X11/xorg.conf
.
Go down to where the driver is identified. This section of the file begins with
Section "Device"
.
There you can change the driver to vesa by having
        Driver      "vesa"
in your file.
For leaving ee and saving the file xorg.conf,
press the key esc,
press the key a and then
press the key a
.
leaving root
End the session as root, type
exit
and you are back as the formal user.
starting x
Initialize the X session by typing
startx
.
Now you need to wait until the X server load for you.
