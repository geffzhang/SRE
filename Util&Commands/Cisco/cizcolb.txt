• FTP - The port number is 21 and is not configurable
• SSL - The port number is 443
• ICMP - The port number is the number for the service 
You can configure a port number from 0 to 65535.
• To specify the keepalive port number for a service, use the service mode 
keepalive port command. For example, to specify port 8080, enter:
(config-service[serv1])# keepalive port 80801-43
