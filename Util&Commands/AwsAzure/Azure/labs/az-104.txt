Encryption key storage requirements
Azure Disk Encryption requires an Azure Key Vault to control and manage disk encryption keys and secrets. Your key vault and VMs must reside in the same Azure region and subscription.

 port 5985 for HTTP transport, and port 5986 for HTTPS


Application Administrators can manage application credentials that allows them to impersonate the application. So, users assigned to this role can manage application credentials of only those applications that are either not assigned to any Azure AD roles or those assigned to following admin roles only:

Application Administrator
Application Developer
Cloud Application Administrator
Directory Readers
If an application is assigned to any other role that are not mentioned above, then Application Administrator cannot manage credentials of that application.

This role also grants the ability to consent to delegated permissions and appli

Azure DNS supports importing and exporting zone files by using the Azure command-line interface (CLI). Zone file import is not currently 
supported via Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal.

INITIATIVE definition is a group of policies 
Create a policy initiative. A policy initiative would include all the policies of interest. 
Once your initiative is created, you can assign the definition to establish its scope.
 A scope determines what resources or grouping of resources the policy assignment gets enforced on.









Global vnet peering is NOT allowed in governement cloud regions (only same region)

Virtual Net GW
VPN type = Route Based (Dynamic route discovery, new vnets will BE auto discover)
	   Policy-Based (Static Routing, new vnets will NOT be auto discover)

SKU - To change from basic the you neeed to delete and create a new with desired SKU
Basic - allow 10 tunnels and 100bps speed connection

Express Route route premium add-on permits connection between Geopolitical regions
Express Route Global Reach (connects via MS backbone)



Deployment options for Express Route and VPN s2s co-existing connections
are only available via Power Shell and NOT the Azure Portal 

HUB and SPOKEN topology
Access VNET from multiple OP sites (multiple offices sharing same VNET)

VNET 2 VNET VPN
2 VNET needs reliable comm to public internet
Require 2 VPNGW allow intra-region traffic among all VNET 
used for SQL high availability, distributing geo disimilar partition conn 
from different VNET


Each Route table can be associated to multiple subnets
 but a subnet can be assigned to only one route table


Load Balancer
SKU cannot be changed after LB creation
Standard SKU is new with more resources
LB rule cannot spam across 2 VNETs you cannot have 2 vm in different VNET and connect with one single LB
LB is geo binded to region and VNET

BASIC LB has no charge is open to the public, 100 estances on backend pool
STANDARD are charged by use, numer of rules and the ammount of data processed
Zone redundancy zone frontends for IN and OUTbound is closed for public IP y default 
up~to 1000 estances on backend pool

LB fronte end are not accessible accoress VNET global peering 
For default LB method is five tuple hash (Source IP Dest Source port Dest port protocol type)
Mandatory config for LB:
Front End IP
Back End pool
Health probes
LB rule

Traffic Manager supports non azure products
LB accross REGIONS
Multivalue - allow to get multiple healthy end popint in a simgle query DNS
incrase availability and reduce latency for new DNS quwery
Subnet - allow to map a set of end user ip add range, inspect the source ip and alolow if exist
example you have a costumer from  a epecific subnet is reouted to a specific end point

Nested End point - connect other traffic manager configured with a different routing method
from the one being configured

Higher Weight higher priority - default 1 from 1 to 1000 


Security Groups low ID are processed first

To delete a File share you need to delete Snapshots first
Snapshots are incrmentally
You keep only the last Snapshot

You need to target policies and review spend budgets across several subscriptions you manage. What

should you do?

servers including assigning permissions . However, she should not have access to other resource groups

inside the subscription. You need to configure role-based access. What should you do?

Azure Files and File Sync 
Files vs Blobs 
File storage5 offers shared storage for applications using the industry standard SMB protocol6. Microsoft Azure virtual machines and cloud services can share file data across application components via mounted shares, and on-premises applications can also access file data in the share. 
Applications running in Azure virtual machines or cloud services can mount a file storage share to access file data, just as a desktop application would mount a typical SMB share. Any number of Azure virtual machines or roles can mount and access the File storage share simultaneously. 
Common uses of file storage 
1	Replace and supplement. Azure Files can be used to completely replace or supplement traditional on-premises file servers or NAS devices. 
2	Access anywhere. Popular operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux can directly mount Azure File shares wherever they are in the world. 
3	Lift and shift. Azure Files makes it easy to “lift and shift” applications to the cloud that expect a file share to store file application or user data. 
4	Azure File Sync. Azure File shares can also be replicated with Azure File Sync to Windows Servers, either on-premises or in the cloud, for performance and distributed caching of the data where it's being used. 
5	Shared applications. Storing shared application settings, for example in configuration files. 
6	Diagnostic data. Storing diagnostic data such as logs, metrics, and crash dumps in a shared location. 
7	Tools and utilities. Storing tools and utilities needed for developing or administering Azure virtual machines or cloud services. 
8	
9	Comparing Files and Blobs 
Sometimes it is difficult to decide when to use file shares instead of blobs or disk shares. Take a minute to review this table that compares the different features. 
Feature 	Description 	When to use 
Azure Files 	Provides an SMB interface, client libraries, and a REST interface that allows access from any¬where to stored files. 	You want to “lift and shift” an application to the cloud which already uses the native file system APIs to share data between it and other applica-tions running in Azure. You want to store development and debugging tools that need to be accessed from many virtual 
Feature 	Description 	When to use 
Azure Blobs 	Provides client libraries and a REST interface that allows unstructured data to be stored and accessed at a massive scale in block blobs. 	You want your application to support streaming and ran-dom-access scenarios.You want to be able to access application data from anywhere. 




With the custom IPsec/IKE policy, you can now configure Azure route-based VPN gateways to use prefix-based traffic selectors with option "PolicyBasedTrafficSelectors", to connect to on-premises policy-based VPN devices. This capability allows you to connect from an Azure virtual network and VPN gateway to multiple on-premises policy-based VPN/firewall devices, removing the single connection limit from the current Azure policy-based VPN gateways.

You can verify that your connection succeeded by using 
the 'Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection' cmdlet, with or without '-Debug'.

Use the following cmdlet example, configuring the values
 to match your own. If prompted, select 'A' in order to run 
'All'. In the example, '-Name' refers to the name of the connection
 that you want to test.

Azure PowerShell

Copy

Try It
Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name VNet1toSite1 -ResourceGroupName TestRG1
After the cmdlet has finished, view the values. In the example below, the connection status shows as 'Connected' and you can see ingress and egress bytes.


Copy
"connectionStatus": "Connected",
"ingressBytesTransferred": 3350904






Get-AzVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name VNet1toVNet4 -ResourceGroupName TestRG1
